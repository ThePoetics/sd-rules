# Rules for Sanguine Dreams---*1990s Vampire: the Masquerade*
A set of custom rules for a long-running Vampire: the Masquerade LARP, compiled from a large 
number of house-rules developed since the release of White Wolf's "Vampire: the Masquerade 
Revised" LARP rulebooks in 1999.

Formally codified in its present form in 2016, the rules packet represented the last major 
update and compilation of systems and mechanics for Lshoan Harah/Sanguine Dreams, a live-action 
role-playing group that continually ran *Vampire: the Masquerade* chronicles from 2001 to 2018.

Over 90% of the rule clarifications and descriptions were written by Poetics in his role as 
Storyteller, and were not meant as a challenge to White Wolf's copyrights in any way; players 
were routinely recommended to purchase World of Darkness sourcebooks, even though most had been 
long out of print. Section 1.1.1 of the final result (Outline.pdf) directly addresses the value 
of these commercial properties.

These files have been uploaded to github for posterity and in honor of the large amount of 
creative, technical, and collaborative labor put into creating them.
